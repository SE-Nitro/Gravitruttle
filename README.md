This is an arcade-style flappy-bird-inspired game, that was designed for the [Truttle1 Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/truttle1-game-jam).

## Instructions
You're a turtle, who landed in space! Collect the boxes to build a rocket to get back home again!

- use W/S or  Up Arrow/Down Arrow to control the turtle
- Land on, or directly below the boxes to collect them
- Try not to collide with the boxes, they can hurt you!
- Unlike flappy-bird, you can lose a life when going through a box pillar without collecting any boxes
- Touching the floor/ceiling reverses the gravity direction
Have fun!
